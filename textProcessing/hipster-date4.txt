Tony (Hipster)

Hi, let's keep it simple.
Would you like to spend some time together but being independent? Have a friend to meet whenever you want for a simple coffee, a yoga class Or a walk on the beach?
I'm an attractive, classy, well groomed and successful person looking for non commitment relation. Means can include some intimate relations but could not be successful if nothing else.
I speak english, French, Spanish and some portuguese and Germán...
Are you in?
