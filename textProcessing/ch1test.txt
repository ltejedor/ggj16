Start Date

TURN1
*Hobbies [30] <5>
#Well I love cats. Don't even get me started on cats. I think I have seventy-three cats right now. It's so hard to keep track anymore. After the first thirty, it's like, who's the owner here anyway? Them or me? Hahaha. Haha.
*Cats [60] <10>
#Oh my god I absolutely LOVE cats! I think I have seventy-three cats right now. It's so hard to keep track anymore. After the first thirty, it's like, who's the owner here anyway? Them or me? Hahaha. Haha.
*My ex [-60] <-30>
#Ugh. You know if you're not over your ex, we don't have to be doing this right now.
*Current events [-35] <0>
#I don't trust the news. The only news I like is the morning news because that's the only time they talk about happy things. The world is a dark and dangerous place; even the illusion of comfort in this desolate hellscape is a futile attempt for a temporary reprieve before succumbing to our inevitable mortality.

TURN2
Question: What do you do for a job?

*I work with wood. [35] <10>
#Ooh, a lumberjack? I've heard you make lots of money. Just curious, how many cats do you think could live off a lumberjack's salary? Three hundred? Five hundred? I'm asking for a friend.
*(LIE) I always wanted to be a painter. [7] <5>
#Aw, how cute. Can you draw me something? Can you draw cats?
*(LIE) I have many passions. [20] <5>
#I know what you mean. How could someone just have one thing they want to do with their life? Personally, I love cuddling cats, but I also love feeding cats, and making cats wear funny clothes, and watching my cats fall in love, and learning cat languages, and melding minds with my cats... Why limit ourselves?
*Odd jobs. [-40] <-10>
#Oh, so nothing reliable? I don't know if I could see myself with someone who doesn't have a real job.

#Really? You can't think of anything better to ask?
*Personal story [20] <10>
#One time, Catticus Finch -- he's my racist cat -- killed my neighbor's pet parakeet and presented it to me as a noble sacrifice. Catticus was all, "rowr" and it was SO. CUTE. And tasty, too!
*Tell a joke [35] <15>
#Hahahaha! I love puns. How did you know?!
*Cooking [-44] <-20>
#What, just because I'm a woman you think I want to talk about cooking? Do you want me to cook for you, is that it? No. Not happening. Just forget it. God. How dare you?

#Okay. Boring.
*Read. [30] <15>
#I love reading! I read this one book about funny stories with talking cats. It was based on a true story. You should read it! You can borrow my copy.
*Meditate. [10] <5>
#Taking time for yourself is important, I guess. One of my older cats, Mr. Meowgi, taught me to clear my mind and align myself with nature. He's a goof. I love Mr. Meowgi.

*Love [55] <33>
#Aw, you're so sweet. Do you love me? Is that what you're trying to say? You're cute. You should meet my Herd. They're going to have to approve of you if we go on a second date, you know.
